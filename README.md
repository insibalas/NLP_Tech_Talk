## English to Tamil & Hindi Translator with Python

This repository contains a Python script that translates English text to Tamil and Hindi using Google Translate API.

**Functionality:**

* The script defines two functions:
    * `translate_english_to_tamil(text)`: Takes English text as input and returns the translated Tamil text.
    * `translate_english_to_hindi(text)`: Takes English text as input and returns the translated Hindi text.

**How it Works:**

1. The script utilizes the `requests` library to make API calls to Google Translate.
2. Each function constructs a URL with the desired language pair (English to Tamil or Hindi) and the text to be translated.
3. The function sends a GET request to the URL and retrieves the JSON response.
4. The script parses the JSON response to extract the translated text.
5. In case of any errors during the translation process, the script catches the exception and prints an error message.

**Example Usage:**

The script includes an example demonstrating how to use the functions:

* Defines an English text variable `english_text`.
* Calls `translate_english_to_tamil` and `translate_english_to_hindi` functions with the English text.
* Prints the translated Tamil and Hindi text.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `translator.py`).
2. Install the `requests` library using `pip install requests` in your terminal.
3. Run the script from the command line: `python translator.py`

**Disclaimer:**

This script uses Google Translate API for translation.  Be aware of Google Translate's limitations and potential inaccuracies, especially for complex or nuanced text.

**Feel free to modify the script to translate between other languages supported by Google Translate API.** You can find information about supported languages in the Google Translate documentation: [https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs)
