## English to Tamil & Hindi Translator with Python

This code  contains a Python script that translates English text to Tamil and Hindi using Google Translate API.

**Functionality:**

* The script defines two functions:
    * `translate_english_to_tamil(text)`: Takes English text as input and returns the translated Tamil text.
    * `translate_english_to_hindi(text)`: Takes English text as input and returns the translated Hindi text.

**How it Works:**

1. The script utilizes the `requests` library to make API calls to Google Translate.
2. Each function constructs a URL with the desired language pair (English to Tamil or Hindi) and the text to be translated.
3. The function sends a GET request to the URL and retrieves the JSON response.
4. The script parses the JSON response to extract the translated text.
5. In case of any errors during the translation process, the script catches the exception and prints an error message.

**Example Usage:**

The script includes an example demonstrating how to use the functions:

* Defines an English text variable `english_text`.
* Calls `translate_english_to_tamil` and `translate_english_to_hindi` functions with the English text.
* Prints the translated Tamil and Hindi text.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* `requests` library (install using `pip install requests`)

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `translator.py`).
2. Install the `requests` library using `pip install requests` in your terminal.
3. Run the script from the command line: `python translator.py`

**Disclaimer:**

This script uses Google Translate API for translation.  Please remember Google Translate's limitations and potential inaccuracies, especially for complex or nuanced text.

**Feel free to modify the script to translate between other languages supported by Google Translate API.** You can find information about supported languages in the Google Translate documentation: [https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs)

* It calculates the frequency distribution of bigrams to analyze word co-occurrence patterns.

**How it Works:**

1. The script leverages NLTK functions for tokenization and n-gram generation.
2. It iterates through each sentence in the corpus and generates unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams using the `ngrams` function.
3. N-grams represent sequences of words that can provide insights into language patterns and word co-occurrence.
4. The code calculates the frequency distribution of bigrams using `FreqDist`, indicating how often each bigram appears in the corpus.

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `ngram_analysis.py`).
2. Make sure you have NLTK installed (`pip install nltk`).
3. Run the script from the command line: `python ngram_analysis.py`

**Output:**

The script will print:

* The total number of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams extracted from the corpus.
* A list of all generated unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.
* The frequency distribution of bigrams, showing the number of times each bigram appears.

**Understanding N-Grams:**

* Unigrams represent single words in the text.
* Bigrams capture the relationship between two consecutive words.
* Trigrams consider the relationship between three consecutive words.

**Applications of N-Grams:**

* N-gram analysis helps understand language patterns and word co-occurrence.
* It finds applications in tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

# Program4

## Stop Word Removal with NLTK

This code  contains Python code demonstrating stop word removal from a text corpus using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.

**Functionality:**

* The script removes stop words (common words like "the," "a," or "is") from a list of tokens (individual words).
* Stop words often carry little meaning and can be filtered out for further analysis.

**How it Works:**

1. The script imports NLTK's stopword functionality and downloads the English stopword list (if not already downloaded).
2. It defines a list of tokens, which could be words from a sentence or document.
3. The code creates a set of stop words using NLTK's pre-defined list of English stop words.
4. It iterates through the token list and filters out any word that is present in the stop word set.
5. The script then prints the filtered list of tokens, which no longer contains stop words.

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `stopword_removal.py`).
2. Make sure you have NLTK installed (`pip install nltk`).
3. Run the script from the command line: `python stopword_removal.py`

**The first time you run the script, it might download the stopwords list from the internet. This is a one-time download.**

**Output:**

The script will print the list of tokens after stop words have been removed.

**Importance of Stop Word Removal:**

* Stop words contribute little to the meaning of a sentence.
* Removing them helps focus on more content-rich words and improve analysis accuracy in sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or other NLP tasks.

**Additional Resources:**

* NLTK Documentation: [link to NLTK documentation]
* NLTK Stopwords: [link to NLTK stopwords documentation]

## Text Normalization with Stemming (Porter Stemmer)

This code  contains Python code that explores stemming, a text normalization technique, using the Porter Stemmer from NLTK.

**Functionality:**

* The script applies Porter Stemming to a list of tokens (individual words) to reduce them to their base forms.
* Stemming aims to group related words with similar meanings by removing suffixes.

**How it Works:**

1. The script imports the Porter Stemmer from NLTK's stemming functionalities.
2. It assumes you have already filtered out stop words from the text (as demonstrated in Program 4).
3. The code creates a Porter Stemmer object, which is used to perform stemming.
4. It iterates through the list of filtered tokens and applies the stemmer to each word.
5. Stemming reduces words to their base forms, for example, "running" becomes "run" and "jumps" becomes "jump."
6. The script then prints the list of stemmed words.

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `text_normalization.py`).
2. Make sure you have NLTK installed (`pip install nltk`).
3. Run the script from the command line: `python text_normalization.py`

**Note:**

* Stemming is an aggressive technique and might not always produce the most accurate base form.
* An alternative approach is lemmatization, which aims to reduce words to their dictionary form while preserving their meaning.

**Output:**

The script will print the list of words after applying Porter Stemming.

**Benefits of Text Normalization:**

* Normalization techniques like stemming can help improve the accuracy of NLP tasks by reducing word variations and focusing on the core meaning.
* It can be useful for tasks like information retrieval, text clustering, or sentiment analysis.

**Additional Resources:**

* NLTK Documentation: [link to NLTK documentation]

**Functionality:**

* The script utilizes CountVectorizer to convert a collection of text documents into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning algorithms.
* CountVectorizer builds a vocabulary of unique words and creates a document-term matrix, where each cell represents the word count for a specific document.

**How it Works:**

1. The script imports CountVectorizer from scikit-learn's feature extraction library.
2. It defines a sample list of text documents (sentences or paragraphs).
3. A CountVectorizer object is created, which analyzes the text and builds a vocabulary of unique words.
4. The `fit_transform` method is called on the vectorizer. It analyzes the documents, builds the vocabulary, and transforms the text into a numerical matrix.
5. This matrix represents the document-term counts, where rows represent documents and columns represent unique words.
6. The code prints the resulting matrix and the feature names (unique words in the vocabulary).

**Running the Script:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `feature_extraction.py`).
2. Make sure you have scikit-learn installed (`pip install scikit-learn`).
